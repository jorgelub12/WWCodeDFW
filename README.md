# What is `WWCodeDFW`?
iOS app for Women Who Code DFW

Design vision: https://invis.io/SFDV9GZW9#/257460173_Jobs_Page

## Getting Started with the Project
https://medium.com/@laurrenreed_40373/getting-started-with-wwcodedfw-ios-workspace-706099108f10

1. Clone down the repo. See [this article](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/) for help.

```sh
$ git clone git@github.com:laurrenreed/WWCodeDFW.git
$ cd WWCodeDFW
```

2. Update cocoapods. Cocoapods has great documentation [here](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html) and [here](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/using-cocoapods.html) in the event that you get lost.
```sh
# Make sure you are running this in the `WWCodeDFW` directory we cd'd into above.
$ pod update
```

If you get a message similar to `bash: pod: command not found` then you need to run `sudo get install cocoapods` to install cocoapods.

3. Open `WWCodeDFW.xcworkspace` in Xcode
4. Build the workspace! (press the play button, or command+r to build)

## Minimum development requirements

Xcode: 8.3

Swift: 3.x

cocoapods: 1.3.1
